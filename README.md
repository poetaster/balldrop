# balldrop.
An experimental musical instrument, made with Godot 3.2, tested to 3.5.

This version of balldrop is based on. 
https://github.com/Bauxitedev/balldrop

This version uses other samples and is intended for mobile phones. I also introduces new sounds, changing the tones played and will introduce more methods.

You can draw lines by tapping an origin and long press to complete. 
Erase (currently all) lines with multiple finger tap.
Change the current scale (partials) with multiple finger drag.

From the original Readme:

Do you remember [BallDroppings](http://www.thaoh.net/BallDroppings/)? I decided to make something similar in Godot, adding some more features and more polished graphics. It turned out to be quite fun to play with, and given some patience you can actually make some cool music with it.

The idea is that there are multiple emitters on the screen that periodically spawn balls. When the balls touch a line, a sound is emitted. The kind of sound depends on the color of the ball, and the pitch of the sound depends on the velocity of the ball.
